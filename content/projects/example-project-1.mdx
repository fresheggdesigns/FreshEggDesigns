## Overview

This project involved a complete redesign of TechCorp's e-commerce platform, focusing on improving user experience and conversion rates. The platform serves over 100,000 active users monthly.

## Research & Discovery

We conducted extensive user research including:

- User interviews with 20+ customers
- Analytics review of the existing platform
- Competitive analysis of top e-commerce sites
- Usability testing sessions

Key findings:
- Checkout process had too many steps
- Product images were low quality
- Mobile navigation was confusing
- Search functionality was inadequate

## Design Process

### Phase 1: Information Architecture

We restructured the site navigation to be more intuitive, grouping products by category and improving the search experience.

### Phase 2: Wireframing

Created low-fidelity wireframes for all key pages, focusing on:
- Simplified checkout flow (reduced from 5 steps to 3)
- Improved product discovery
- Enhanced mobile experience

### Phase 3: Visual Design

Developed a modern design system with:
- Consistent color palette
- Typography scale
- Component library
- Spacing system

### Phase 4: Prototyping & Testing

Built interactive prototypes in Figma and conducted usability testing with 15 users. Iterated based on feedback before development.

## Key Features

1. **Streamlined Checkout**: Reduced steps and added progress indicators
2. **Enhanced Product Pages**: Larger images, better descriptions, improved reviews
3. **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layout optimized for all devices
4. **Improved Search**: Better filters and sorting options
5. **Design System**: Reusable components for faster development

## Results

The redesign was a significant success:

- **35% increase in sales**
- **42% cart abandonment rate** (down from 68%)
- **50% increase in mobile conversions**
- **40% faster development** with new design system
- **4.8/5 user satisfaction** score

## Lessons Learned

- User research is crucial - we discovered pain points we didn't anticipate
- Mobile-first approach paid off significantly
- Design systems save time and improve consistency
- Iterative testing led to better final outcomes
