## New to the Creamery Business, Hawthorne Creek wanted their Brand & Digital Footprint to shine!

Right before the Global Pandemic hit, the owners of Hawthorne Creek approached us to help get their company off the ground. Boy did they have good timing! 

We were able to get their website up & running just in time to leverage their e-Commerce platform as a key business measure for the year. Learn more about the making of their products below.
