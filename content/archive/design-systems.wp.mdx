Over the last 4 years, I've built and evolved a global design system that increased adoption by 25% and streamlined collaboration across engineering and design.

*The following is a local example of my own design system to demonstrate the skillsets & technique at scale for branded strategies. *

### Tokens

- Color, Spacing, Radius, Shadow

### Variables

- Named values that store design-related properties (like global colors & typography)

### Components

- The combination of tokens & variables used to make up the core elements of design

### Properties

- Variants

- Booleans

- Instant Swap

### Patterns

- Combination of Components to standardize repeatable design elements

### Challenge

Many design organizations work quickly but in silos. I've worked over the past 3 years to build out a scalable design system & encourage adoption across teams. 

In FY'24, the **9 product teams** of Store Tech increased Design System adoption by **25%**. 

 

### Solution

Working with another designer, we collaborated to create a robust, global design system made up of **semantic themes**. The themes allow for departments to utilize individual & unique styling, serving the use cases & experiential needs of our user groups. 

#### Component Properties

### Variants & Booleans

Using systems thinking principles, I love identifying common data aggregation opportunities & translating those commonalities into variants & booleans.

 Component properties typically **reduce redundant Figma components** by upwards of 40%

#### Components & patterns

### Design System in Action

I've created my own simple design system in a personal Figma file to demonstrate my understanding & abilities. This design system is currently being pressure tested with one of my AI prototyping projects, so these compents will actually be translated into code.

Scalable system also support future pages & feature exploration with minimal overhead & rework.
