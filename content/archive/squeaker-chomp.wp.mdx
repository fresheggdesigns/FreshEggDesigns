**Timeline:** 4 weeks of rapid iteration

**Goal:** Create a playful, functional mobile-friendly game that captures the joy of my best buddy chasing his favorite squeaky toys

### The Spark (Concept + Problem Framing)

Squeaker Chomp was a loose idea in my brain inspired by my dog’s obsession with destroying squeakers and his hilarious quirks like couch climbing.

I wanted to bring this behavior to life in a quick way and create a game that had a similar look & feel to some of my favorite addictive games: Tiny Wings, Angry Birds, etc...

Challenge: As a product designer, I had limited game-dev background, so I needed to find fast ways to prototype.

#### Early Exploration with AI

## Replit AI

#### Used as a rapid sandbox to scaffold early gameplay mechanics

Replit AI helped me:

Stand up a working browser-based prototype quickly.

Test core interactions like “dog catching falling squeakers.”

**Limitations of Replit AI:** debugging was slow (and often frustrating), with, repetitive loops in messaging, and I quickly maxed out credits while chasing errors.

**Learning:** AI prototyping was a great *proof of concept* tool, but not sustainable for scaling a real game.

 

**Known Bugs in the Prototype Build: **

Tap to Jump errors on mobile web & isnt mapped properly in the code. 

The Level system is stuck in a loop and won't allow for further progression after level 1. 

UI mechanics (like the pause button) are clunky

#### Learning & Building

### **Transitioning to Unity**

After meticulous research, I chose to learn the Unity game enginer for scalability, polish, and mobile build potential.

Steep learning curve → I invested 10's of hours over the course of weeks:

Unity’s new Input System for mobile/keyboard controls

Camera bounds & clamping to fit the dog sprite

Health + score systems (heart display, leaderboard)

UI Toolkit menus (main menu, pause, game over states)

Chat GPT was a critical resource in my debugging journey (console errors, merge conflicts, input freezes).
