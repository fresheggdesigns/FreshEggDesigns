### While at Leap Technology,  I worked on exciting initatives such as the Admin v3 design system & investigating future opportunities for product scalability.

In just 2 years with the company, I traveled to 3 high-profile events & conducted onsite ethnographic & field research. As a result of these research efforts, I presented several presentations to our own internal Senior Leadership team as well as to Client's directly targeting what we can be doing to improve our end-to-end user experiences. Additionally, I investigated how we can leverage data & analytics tools, such as Pendo, to be more proactive in our problem solving approach.

#### Research

I was given the opportunity to travel onsite to high-profile events, for clients such as NFL & Disney, and conduct field research, targeting end-to-end user experiences as well as specific feature releases. After returning from these events, I often put together a slide deck of consolidate notes & key takeaways, and was asked on a few occasions to present these findings to our Senior Leadership team.

#### Reservations 

The following feature was created from the ground up utilizing UX best practices, such as quick-pick filtering (based on chunking) & grouped multi-selection which you will find in most social media platforms. All sides of our product team from Product Management to Engineering collaborated to make these designs a reality.

Additionally, usability testing was conducted prior to launch to ensure this feature was easy to use. When launched recently, we recieved great feedback from end-users on the ease of use of this product.

### **Feature Re-Design: **

While working for Patron Tech, I was given the opportunity to analyze & propose a re-design of an existing feature to overcome identified pain points. The tool targeted for re-design is a powerful yet complex software that Automates data and content for selected Attendee / End User interaction. A primary example is configuring this automation tool to query all the Attendees registered to attend an event, then identifying a smaller subgroup of them that have interacted with the onsite gamification services & awarding a chosen number of attendees within that group a special prize.

The singular, greyscale image is an example of the current feature. At first glance the UI is fairly outdated.

Even more so, there are an overwhelming number of input fields & configuration options available, which often left users wondering "where do I go first". I identified that **Cognitive Overload** was a leading pain point associated with this complex feature. After conducting stakeholder interviews, I also noted that a primary driver for improving the UX of this tool is to improve the onboarding and training for internal users.

 

The gallery of more modern images is my proposed design solution that was established after months of research, testing, & iteration. Early on in the process, I identified that **Chunking **could be used to focus user's attention towards specific content and actions.

My project team and I finally landed on a **vertical-stepped wizard** that would target groupings of info and additionally provide contextual help along the way. Additionally, Error states & required fields are now able to be visually targeted & specifically target the users attention to the content that needs adjustment.

A LOT of research, iteration, and testing went into both the Reservations & Automations features. These are 2 great examples of where business & technical knowledge can help a UX Designer really be foreward thinking in any industry, and I would love to talk your ear off about it so please reach out if you'd like to learn more about my process for these efforts!

#### End user facing processes 

As a result of my findings during several of my onsite field studies, I've targeted modernizing and updating current Attendee facing activation processes to adopt the "mobile first" mentality. Because 82% of our end-users are accessing our product on Mobile devices, it would be a disservice to ourselves to not provide clean & intuitive interfaces for them in the most widely utilized platforms. Similarly, our onsite product offerings are almost always accessed via integrated tablet devices, so there's a direct need more more customizable & scalable interfaces to meet the needs of our variety of clients & users alike.
