During my 3 years at DSG, I've had the incredible opportunity to work on a diverse array of projects. From an Appointment Scheduling web experience to a Sales & Service application, the problems have been complex but the impact & value to our Store Teammates and Athlete Customers has been significant!

 

#### Application design

### Sideline Assist

I've been the lead designer on the innovative sales & service application for the last year. Sideline Assist is one of DSG's newest products & has been design driven using a modern React Native tech stack & our internal design system. Sideline Assist sees on average **16k DAU** with **3M+ Product Scans** (in the last 30 days).

This application also houses a **patent-pending AI integration** that was born from an engineering + design partnership.

 

#### Application design

### ShoeRunner

The patented application for allowing customers to request shoes to try on in-store has been around for about 7 years. ShoeRunner sees **millions of shoe requests annually** & footwear makes up ~20% of our total business. This puts design in a uniquely impactful position to drive incremental value for the business, while also improving the fulfillment processes of our store teammates. 

However, the ShoeRunner application hasnt seen a significant modernization effort in the last 5 years. I had to partner with business stakeholders & product management to **craft a compelling business case to prioritize modernization** onto the same tech stack as our other product above, streamlining development efficiencies, and allowing for enhanced experience design.

**95K+ kiosk shoe requests** (single day record)

**+23% YoY** kiosk request volume

 

## Skillset Highlights

### Product Design

During my time at DSG, I've had the opportunity to improve my Figma technical skillsets, optimizing component & screen builds with Auto-Layout and leaning into semantic variables. 

Additionally, I've hosted several Figma workshops internally & am actively leading Figma training sessions to upskill other designers.

Partner closely with product, engineering, and business partners to align design decisions with strategic KPIs & long-term vision (including UPT growth + increased conversion

Utilize my training from the ROI of Design certification to build Impact Maps and strategically connect design results to business processes.

I've created 2 robust visionary plans, using input from all members of our product team, to create alignment and intention as we continue to develop features. 

The sales & service vision includes a polished slide deck with concepts ranging from Fitting Room innovation to AI driven product bundling. 

Lastly, I'm actively working to create a similar plan & roadmap for our widely successful ShoeRuner application! Hopefully leveraging Cursor AI to have design drive the build of a functional prototype for usability testing.

I personallly built key components such as buttons, cards, accordions, & inputs to fill out library with assets for designers to leverage in their work.

Alongside another design counterpart (& after attending Figma Config 2024), we established semantic theming as part of our gobal design system. 

Patterns are arguably where the bulk of design systems value starts to actualize. 

I've helped Store Tech teammates align on key patterns such as: Navigation, login, product cards, and more. 

### Design Systems

## **Research & Discovery Artifacts**

As a Senior Product Designer, I'm responsible for leading research & testing to unpack ambiguous problem areas and uncover net-new business opportunities. 

As a member of Store Technology, I've had the unique experience of conducting **in-person & virtual interviews, field research, and ethnographic studies** of our store employees, connecting everyday problems to strategic business impact. 

### **Workshops**

I've hosted many cross-team and multi-disciplinary workshops to create alignment on complex initiatives, document thematic opportunity areas, and define next steps / action items.

I've also created reusable templates that have helped standardize & streamline workshops for others & created consistent artifacts to guide continuous conversation.  

#### **Journey Maps & Service Blueprints**

### **Impact Mapping**

As a result of the ROI of Design training certification, I've brought the unique technique of creating Impact Maps into the org to **connect additional design-driven value to quanitifiable financial outcomes**.

This applied technique gives designers more opportunity to connect user problems to business opportunities, and as a result I was even asked to present to SLT members.

### **My Anxiety Superpower**

One of upsides to being a Type A individual is taking messes and turning them into neatly organized & documented files. 

I have a proven track record of entering product teams, **cleaning up disorganized files, and bringing consistent handoff processes** to improve team efficiencies & ways fo working.
