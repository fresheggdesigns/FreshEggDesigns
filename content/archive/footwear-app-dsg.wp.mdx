As** Lead Designer**, I redefined the vision and modernization strategy for Dick’s Sporting Goods’ patented Footwear App, a platform directly tied to** ~$2B in annual footwear sales**. My role spanned from crafting the business case for modernization to leading design execution across customer kiosks, employee apps, and roadmap alignment, resulting in record-setting 350k+ shoe requests in a single day.

 

 

### *Please note that any screens, visual artifacts, and/or data points are proprietary to Dick's Sporting Goods and are not allowed to be shared or distributed in any manner.*

#### Application design

### ShoeRunner

The Footwear App had been in use for ~7 years with minimal updates. While it processed **tens of millions of requests annually**, its aging tech stack and fragmented design created:

Slow and inconsistent kiosk experiences for customers.

Fulfillment inefficiencies for store associates.

A lack of integration with newer platforms, limiting scalability and innovation.

To maintain footwear’s critical role in Dick’s business, modernization was no longer optional, but essential.

#### STRATEGY & ALIGNMENT

### My Role & Approach

As the **Lead Designer**, I partnered with product management, engineering, and business stakeholders to:

**Craft the business case** for modernization, tying design improvements directly to revenue impact.

Lead **vision setting and roadmap alignment** for ShoeRunner 2.0.

Redesign both the **customer kiosk** and **employee-facing app**, ensuring efficiency across the full request and delivery journey.

Conduct **user interviews, usability testing, and field studies** to uncover pain points.

Introduce **impact mapping** to connect design outcomes to quantifiable business and financial results — a practice later presented to senior leadership (SLT).

## **Research & Discovery Artifacts**

Through **in-store ethnographic studies, usability testing, and associate interviews**, I uncovered key friction points

### **User Interviews**

A series of thorough & regional User Interviews + Usability testing reveal opportunity areas in 3 key areas:

**1) Customers struggled with kiosk navigation and product discovery.**

**2) Associates experienced inconsistent fulfillment flows and poor visibility into shoe requests.**

**3) Terminology and workflows varied store-to-store, leading to training challenges.**

#### **Journey Maps & Service Blueprints**

These insights informed **journey maps, service blueprints, and redesigned flows**, directly connecting everyday pain points to business-critical improvements.

### **Impact Mapping**

I introduced impact mapping to connect design to measurable business and financial outcomes. This method increased leadership visibility into design’s ROI, and I was invited to **present to SLT.**

 

## **Customer Kiosk**

Redesigned from a text-heavy, legacy system to a **visual, product-first experience** with a clear linear path. 

The new designs also leverage the latest & greatest self-service kiosks that Samsung has to offer, requiring the designs to be **responsive & scalable** to a new suite of Kiosk devices.

**Before**

**After**

## **Employee App**

Improved visibility into inventory and delivery queues, reducing fulfillment errors and improving speed-to-deliver.

**Challenges faced with Modernization:** getting this larger body of work prioritized required a lot of back & forth between business teams to prove out a quanitfiable value case & estimate to associate with this work. "Value" in this case had to be delivered through storytelling of not just business metrics (such as Conversion, Delivery Times, & # of Requests) but also qualitative Teammate feedback, illustrating the many pain points they currently deal with on the footwear decks. 

**TLDR**: DSG's Footwear Business is slated to grown exponentially over the next 3 years, but that will not be possible without a strong technological foundation & efficient Teammate processes.

**Before Modernization**

**After Modernization**

### This project reinforced that **design leadership is about influence, not just interfaces**. ****

#### My key takeaways:

#### Building the **business case for design** is often the unlock for modernization at scale.

#### Connecting **user problems → business impact → financial outcomes** drives executive alignment.

#### Modernization efforts must balance **customer experience and associate efficiency**, ensuring impact across the full ecosystem.

#### ShoeRunner continues to drive record adoption and revenue, serving as proof that **strategic design leadership can unlock measurable business value.**
