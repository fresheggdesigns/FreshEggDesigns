As **Lead Designer**, I defined the vision and design strategy for Dick’s Sporting Goods’ Sales & Service platform, driving adoption to **800+ stores** and enabling **16k+ daily active users** with over **3M product scans per month**. This work spanned from research and problem framing to design systems integration, feature development, and cross-functional alignment.

#### Application design

### Sideline Assist

As the **Lead Designer for the Clienteling App (Sideline Assist)**, I partnered with product, engineering, and operations to:

Establish the **strategic vision** for Sideline Assist as a high-traffic sales & service platform.

Lead **research & discovery**, including in-store ethnographic studies and associate interviews.

Translate insights into **journey maps, service blueprints, and feature opportunities**.

Apply our **internal design system** to scale consistent, high-quality UI across all flows.

Facilitate **cross-team workshops** to align 9+ product groups and prioritize adoption.

- Create visual artifacts & documentation for the **patent-pending** AI capability

**Before**

**After**

### **Key Outcomes**

**Performance Gains: Reduced scan speeds by several seconds, aligning to the retail best practice of <1 second response time.**

I was brought onto the Sales & Service team specifically to manage the rollout of this cutting-edge application, as well as create the strategic vision for this product.

Almost immediately, I discovered some crucial functionality issues with **scan speeds & general app performance**, but quickly worked with the product team to **reduce scan speecds by several seconds** & set general load & scan speed guidelines to adhere to the **<1 sec. best practice**.

In addition to this critical work, I was able to utilize **design-debt** focused Jira Tickets to accomplish a **home page redesign** in a parallel path to the performance enhancements. 

## **Research & Discovery Artifacts**

As a Senior Product Designer, I'm responsible for leading research & testing to unpack ambiguous problem areas and uncover net-new business opportunities. 

As a member of Store Technology, I've had the unique experience of conducting **in-person & virtual interviews, field research, and ethnographic studies** of our store employees, connecting everyday problems to strategic business impact. 

### **Workshops**

I've hosted many cross-team and multi-disciplinary workshops to create alignment on complex initiatives, document thematic opportunity areas, and define next steps / action items.

I've also created reusable templates that have helped standardize & streamline workshops for others & created consistent artifacts to guide continuous conversation.  

#### **Journey Maps & Service Blueprints**

Journey maps & Service Blueprints exposed pain points between store Teammates & the expectations of customer Athletes, highlighting opportunities for rich  & quickly scannable product content, as well as leveraging AI to parse our dense catalog of product and provide quick, sport related recommendations to support relationship building for both employee + customer.

### **Product Details Page**

**Consolidates all necessary functionality into 1 streamlined, scrollable view. PDPs are the most accessed feature, viewed millions of times monthly.**

### **Loyalty Lookup**

**The first in-store integration of our ScoreCard loyalty program, that provides store Teammates with helpful clienteling information.**

### **Sport Search******

**An AI powered, patent pending capability that parses our immense product catalog & recommends product based on activity related prompts**

### **Operational Impact**

**Driving Efficiency & Consistency**

I have a provemn track record of entering teams and transforming messy, disorganized files into scalable, documented systems. 

This improved collaboration with engineering and reduced handoff errors. (I jokingly call this my ‘Anxiety Superpower.’)

**Before ** (chaotic files w/ low findability)

**After**  (clean, organized file structure w/ dev. documentaion)

### **REFLECTIONS & LESSONS LEARNED**

This project reinforced that **design at scale is not just about UI. Adoption, alignment, and measurable outcomes **are crucial to any projects success. My role was as much about:

**Driving cross-functional vision** as it was about screen design.

**Bridging research to strategy** so everyday associate workflows translated into business impact.

**Building for longevity**, ensuring the platform could evolve with new AI integrations and future use cases.

Sideline Assist is now a cornerstone of Dick’s in-store strategy, proof of how **design leadership can deliver impact at scale.**
